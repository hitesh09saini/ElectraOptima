        <div class="learn" id="learnMore" >
           
            <p><strong>Single-Family Home:</strong> A standalone dwelling designed for one family. It typically has a front and backyard, offering more privacy and space compared to multi-family homes.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Apartment:</strong> A unit within a multi-story building. It's often part of a larger complex with shared amenities. Apartments are ideal for individuals, couples, or small families.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Condominium (Condo):</strong> Similar to an apartment but owned rather than rented. Owners share common areas and pay fees for maintenance. Condos provide a balance of ownership and communal living.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Townhouse:</strong> Attached homes in a row, sharing walls with neighbors. Often multi-story with a small yard or patio. Combines aspects of single-family and condo living.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Duplex:</strong> A building divided into two separate units. Can be owner-occupied or used for rental income.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Mobile Home/Manufactured Home:</strong> A prefabricated home that can be transported to a specific location. Typically located in mobile home parks or on private land.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Cooperative (Co-op):</strong> Residents own shares in the cooperative corporation rather than owning individual units. Co-op boards often have a say in who can become a resident.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Bungalow:</strong> A single-story house with a sloping roof and front porch. Often chosen for its accessibility and cozy design.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Cottage:</strong> A small, cozy house, usually located in a rural or scenic location. Perfect for those seeking a retreat from city life.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Mansion:</strong> A large, luxurious home often associated with wealth. Features extensive amenities and space.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Ranch-style Home:</strong> A single-story home with a long, low-profile design. Typically features an open floor plan.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Colonial Home:</strong> A classic American home with symmetrical design. Often has two or more stories with a centered front door.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Victorian Home:</strong> Known for intricate, ornate designs and multiple stories. Often features decorative details and asymmetrical architecture.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Cabin:</strong> A small, rustic home, usually located in a natural setting.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Earthship:</strong> An eco-friendly, self-sustaining home built using natural and recycled materials. Designed to minimize environmental impact.</p>
