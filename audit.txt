Calculating your energy consumption is a crucial step in a home energy audit, as it provides you with a clear picture of how much energy you're using and where it's being used the most. To calculate your energy consumption, follow these steps:

1. **Gather Your Energy Bills:**
   - Collect your electricity and gas bills for the last 12 months. You'll need this historical data to analyze your energy usage trends.

2. **Find Your Usage Data:**
   - Locate the sections on your energy bills that show your monthly or quarterly energy usage in units like kilowatt-hours (kWh) for electricity and therms or cubic feet (CCF) for gas.

3. **Create a Spreadsheet or Chart:**
   - Use a spreadsheet software or create a simple table to organize your energy usage data. Create columns for the following:
     - Month or Billing Period
     - Electricity Usage (kWh)
     - Gas Usage (CCF or therms)
     - Total Energy Usage (kWh equivalent for gas)

4. **Calculate Total Energy Usage:**
   - If your gas usage is measured in CCF or therms, convert it to kilowatt-hours (kWh) to have a consistent unit of measurement. The conversion factor should be available on your gas bill or from your utility company. Typically, 1 CCF of natural gas is roughly equivalent to 29.3 kWh.
   - Add up your electricity and gas usage for each month or billing period to calculate your total energy usage in kWh.

5. **Analyze Your Energy Usage Patterns:**
   - Look for trends in your energy consumption. Are there months when your usage is significantly higher? Identify any patterns or anomalies.

6. **Categorize Your Energy Consumption:**
   - Categorize your energy consumption by major areas, such as heating, cooling, lighting, appliances, hot water, and other. Estimate the percentage of energy consumed by each category based on your usage data and any available information on energy consumption from specific devices or systems.

7. **Identify Peak Energy Usage Times:**
   - Determine if there are specific times of day or days of the week when your energy usage spikes. This can help pinpoint when you might be using energy less efficiently.

8. **Set Baseline and Goals:**
   - Establish a baseline for your energy consumption based on your historical data.
   - Set energy-saving goals for each category, aiming to reduce your consumption in areas where you use the most energy.

9. **Compare to Similar Homes:**
   - If possible, compare your energy usage to that of similar homes in your area to see how you stack up in terms of efficiency.

10. **Plan for Improvements:**
    - Use the data you've gathered to prioritize improvements in areas where you can reduce energy consumption. This might include upgrading appliances, improving insulation, adjusting thermostat settings, or changing your lighting.

By calculating your energy consumption and analyzing the data, you can make informed decisions about how to reduce energy usage, lower your energy bills, and make your home more energy-efficient.
